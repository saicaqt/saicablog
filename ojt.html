        <h1>STI OJT Experience</h1>
          <p>Becoming an On-the-Job Trainee (OJT) at my school was one of the most fun and meaningful experiences of my academic journey. It gave me the opportunity to work closely with my teachers and school staff, which allowed me to form stronger bonds with them. They were very supportive and welcoming, making my time as an OJT both enjoyable and educational. What made it even more special was seeing firsthand how dedicated and hardworking the teachers and staff were in handling their responsibilities. It made me appreciate all the effort that goes on behind the scenes to keep the school running smoothly.

Throughout my OJT, I gained new skills and valuable experience that helped me grow both personally and professionally. I was taught how to apply my IT knowledge in real-world situations, which helped me understand the importance of the lessons we learned in class. From basic troubleshooting to assisting in managing technical equipment, every task helped build my confidence. I discovered abilities I didn’t know I had, and it felt rewarding to be trusted with responsibilities.

One of the most exciting parts of my OJT experience was being able to contribute during events in our city. Being involved in these activities made me feel like a part of something bigger. It showed me how even students like us can make a difference in the community through our skills and efforts.

Overall, my OJT experience at STI was more than just training—it was a time of growth, discovery, and connection. I will always be grateful for the opportunity to be part of it. It helped shape my character and prepared me for future challenges in the professional world. I feel lucky and proud to have been an STI OJT, and I will cherish the memories and lessons I gained from this experience.</p>
