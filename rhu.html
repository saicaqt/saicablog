        <h1>Building a System Experience</h1>
          <p>Creating a system is really challenging, and this research project was no exception. There were times when it felt difficult and overwhelming, but in the end, it was all worth it. What made it manageable and meaningful was having dedicated teammates—especially Resh—who constantly motivated me to give my best for the group. We didn’t just do this for the grade; we created this project with the intention of helping civilians improve their health. Because of that purpose, I will always be proud that we completed this capstone and made a positive impact.</p>
